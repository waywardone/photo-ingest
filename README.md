# photo-ingest


## About

Tool(s) I personally use to organize photographs I take using various cameras and phones. This covers the gamut of renaming, rotating, adding copyright notices and storing them in a personally appealing folder structure.



## Usage


```sh
# PowerShell version
.\photo-ingest.ps1 -srcdir C:\Path\To\Directory\With\Images -artist "Copyright Holder" -groupby md -device "iPhone"

# Bash (Linux and WSL on Windows only) version
./photo-ingest.sh -s /path/to/directory/with/images -a "Copyright Holder" -g md -c "iPhone"
```
